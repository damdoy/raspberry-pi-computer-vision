# Minimal example of MMAL library on raspberry pi

Simplest use case possible of the mmal library to get RGB frames out of the raspberry pi camera without too much hassle.

Display RGB frames directly on the framebuffer. No GUI needed, only a screen on hdmi.

Tested on a raspberry Pi 3 B, with a raspberry pi camera V2.1 on Raspbian 10
