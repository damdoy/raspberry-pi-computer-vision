# Raspberry Pi Computer vision tools

Collection of low level computer vision tools on raspberry pi, mainly used as a learning tool for myself to learn the algorithms, their optimisations on ARM arch with the goal to maybe implement them on fpga one day.

They are using the raspberry pi and will display the result on the framebuffer, no need of window manager.

Tested on Raspberry pi 3 with the camera v2.1
